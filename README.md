```

Bun

```bash
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DEV_TOKEN=your_development_bot_token (optional)
DEV_CLIENT_ID=your_development_client_id (optional)
OPENROUTER_TOKEN=your_openrouter_api_token (optional, for title processing)
DEV_OPENROUTER_TOKEN=your_dev_openrouter_api_token (optional)
MODEL=your_ai_model (optional, for title processing)
DEV_MODEL=your_dev_ai_model (optional)
```

4. Set up your Discord bot:
    - Create a new application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - Create a bot and copy the token
    - Enable the following bot permissions:
        - Send Messages
        - Use Slash Commands
        - Connect to Voice Channels
        - Speak in Voice Channels
        - Use Voice Activity

## Prerequisites

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime (Node.js is recommended for better compatibility)
- Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for audio processing (required for voice channel audio playback)
- Install [FFprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for audio file metadata extraction (required for clip length validation)
- Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading YouTube audio (required for playing clips)

## Usage

1. Start the bot:

Bun
```bash
bun run index.ts
```
or Node.js
```bash
npx tsc # Compile TypeScript files
node dist/index.js
```

2. Invite the bot to your Discord server with the required permissions

3. Join a voice channel and run `/start` with a YouTube playlist URL

4. Use the interactive buttons or commands to control the game

## Command Line Flags

- `--refreshCommands` or `-R`: Force refresh slash commands on startup
- `--dev` or `-D`: Run in development mode (uses `DEV_TOKEN` and `DEV_CLIENT_ID` from `.env`)
- `--log` or `-L`: Enable detailed logging (logs to `logs/` directory)
- `--no_warn` or `-N`: Suppress warning messages in the console
- `--no_important`: Suppress important messages in the console
- `--debug` or `-B`: Enable debug mode (logs all messages, including debug information)
- `--noTitleCleaning`: Disable AI-powered title cleaning and processing (use raw YouTube titles)

## Runtime Commands

While the bot is running, you can use these console commands:

- `/exit` - Gracefully shut down the bot, finish downloads, and save cached data
- `/reload` - Reload all commands without restarting the bot

## Development

The project uses TypeScript and is structured as follows:

- `commands/` - Slash command implementations
- `lib/` - Core bot functionality
    - `discord/` - Discord interaction handling and UI components
    - `voice/` - Voice channel and audio handling
    - `youtube/` - YouTube API integration and lyrics processing
    - `commands/` - Command registration and management
    - `env/` - Environment variable and command line flag handling
    - `utils/` - Utility functions and formatting
- `data/` - Cached titles and metadata storage
- `logs/` - Application logs (organized by date and development mode)
